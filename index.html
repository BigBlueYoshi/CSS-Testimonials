            <p class="card_lead">After spending next to a month trying to get this project done with a different company, and giving up because they just didn't *get* what I wanted/needed, I found This Company</p>
            <p class="card_quote">"They were wonderful to work with. We communicated easily, they totally understood what I needed. And worked with me if there was something I didn't explain clearly. They finished several days early and disigned a beautiful site for me. I will use them again and again on anything that has to do with web design! They were very patient and great at answering questions.I look foward to working with them again. I am happy with how my site looks and everything works well. The site was finished faster than our original timeline."</p>

                They spent a lot of time looking at my website and giving me feedback. They finished the project like I asked quickly and kept constant communication with me. I would recommend.

They are very good at their work. Knows their stuff! Delivered exactly what was promised...in fact...site speed was 96% on Gmetrix. Spent a lot of time explaining stuff beyond the mandate. Will definitely work with them again"
